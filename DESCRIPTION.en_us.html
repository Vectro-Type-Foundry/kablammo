<p>Kablammo is an experimental variable font. It takes inspiration from maximalist curly doodad designs from the â€™90s, as well as Nickelodeon cartoons and toys from that era. Kablammo was designed by <a href='https://www.vectrotype.com'>Vectro Type Foundry</a>, released in 2023.</p>

<p>Kablammo has one variable axis, Mutation(MUTA), which makes the glyphs dance. The decorative elements fly all over the place along with a shifting weight and contrast. This lends itself particularly well to animations.</p>
