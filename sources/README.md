# Production Notes

### Software

The following software and scripts was used in the production of this typeface family:
* [Glyphs (v2)](https://glyphsapp.com)
* [KablammoScripts](https://github.com/scribbletone/kablammo-scripts)

#### Generating fonts

[KablammoScripts](https://github.com/scribbletone/kablammo-scripts) contains many useful scripts for various parts of the project. Most you can ignore, with the exception of 'Generate Reverse Alts. This script should be run before generation of the fonts, especially if changes are made to glyphs that get swapped by contextual alternates. This script copies glyphs and creates their contextual alternate by reversing the order of masters they appear on.
